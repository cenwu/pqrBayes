\title{Regularized Bayesian Quantile Varying Coefficient Model}
\description{
In this package, we implement a Bayesian quantile varying coefficient model for non-linear gene-environment interaction analysis. The varying 
coefficient functions capture the possible non-linear gene-environment interactions and they are approximated using linear combinations of B-spline basis. 
Quantile regression is adopted as it's robust to long-tailed distributions in the response/phenotype and provides the capability of describing the relationship 
between the response variable and predictors at different quantiles of the response variable. The default method (the proposed method) conducts variable 
selection by accounting for sparsity. In particular, the spike--and--slab priors are adopted to shrink the coefficients of unimportant effects to exactly zero. 
In addition to the default method, users can also choose the method without spike--and--slab priors.
}
\details{
The user friendly, integrated interface \strong{pqrBayes()} allows users to flexibly choose the fitting methods by specifying the following parameter:
\tabular{rl}{
sparse: \tab whether to use the spike-and-slab priors to impose sparsity. 
}

The function pqrBayes() returns a pqrBayes object that contains the posterior estimates of each coefficients.
