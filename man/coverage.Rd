\title{95\% empirical coverage probability for a pqrBayes object}
\usage{
coverage(object,coefficient,u.grid=NULL,model="linear")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{the pqrBayes object.}

\item{coefficient}{the vector of true regression coefficients under a linear model or the matrix of true varying coefficients evaluated on the grid points under a varying coefficient model.}

\item{u.grid}{the vector of grid points under a varying coefficient model. When assessing empirical coverage probabilities under a linear model, u.grid = NULL.}

\item{model}{the model to be fitted. Users can also choose "linear" for a linear model or "VC" for a varying coefficient model.}
}
\value{
c
}
\description{
Calculate 95\% empirical coverage probabilities for regression coefficients under linear and VC models, respectively.
