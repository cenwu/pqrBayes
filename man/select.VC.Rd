\title{Variable selection for a pqrBayes object}
\usage{
VCselect(obj, sparse, iterations = 10000, kn = 2, degree = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{pqrBayes object.}

\item{sparse}{logical flag.}

\item{iterations}{the number of MCMC iterations.}

\item{kn}{the number of interior knots for B-spline.}

\item{degree}{the degree of B-spline basis.}
}
\value{
an object of class `VCselect' is returned, which includes the indices of the selected predictors (e.g. genetic factors).
}
\description{
Variable selection for a pqrBayes object
}
\details{
For class `Sparse', the median probability model (MPM) (Barbieri and Berger, 2004) is used to identify predictors that are significantly associated
with the response variable. For class `NonSparse', variable selection is based on 95\% credible interval.
Please check the references for more details about the variable selection.
